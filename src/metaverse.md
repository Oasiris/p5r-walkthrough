### Palace Tips
#### Efficient Leveling
* Look for enemies weak to Gun and spam your normal gun attack for knock downs since ammo replenishes fully after every battle
* Use ailments and Phys skills with ailment effects to buy time in random encounters if they deal a lot of damage and follow up with Technicals
* Avoid challenging flaming shadows until you are close to securing the Treasure Route to ensure you have enough SP and level gains
* The 3rd Will Seed in every palace in guarded by a mini-boss with a short skill cycle you can exploit
* Specific Treasure Demons are a lot easier to find in their source palace with a Treasure Trap rather than crawling Mementos to catch them later on
* At Lv. 18 you can fuse Shiki-Ouji which nulls Phys, Gun, Bless, and Curse, which you can use to solo rush some otherwise troublesome encounters later on
* Death Rank 7 sells Invigorate 3 accessories for Y50,000 each allowing you to be much more generous with SP afterwards
* Near late game the fastest way to gain levels, money, and items is to use Chariot Rank 7 combined with Jose's Mementos changes to continuously ambush and instant kill enemies
* In late game level your Technical rank to 5 so you get guaranteed knockdowns even against the random encounters without weaknesses

#### Castle Palace
* If you want the "Expert Lockpicker" award early on you can save-reload the locked chest in front of the Safe Room
* Get the timing right on the rooftop flaming shadow patrol to avoid futile encounters
* Angel spawns near the end are weak to Gun

#### Mementos Palace
* Time your visits so you can clear a bunch of requests at once while still advancing your confidants
* Make it all the way to the next locked stairs before returning

#### Museum Palace
* If you level to 15 before the scripted Regent encounter you can fuse a persona with Frei to knock it down
* The Will Seed mini-boss follows up Flash Bomb and Brain Jack with Psi attacks aiming for Technical damage
* Exploit the obvious weaknesses during phase 2 of the boss fight to Baton Pass chain ending with Joker for maximum damage

#### Bank Palace
* The backups in phase 2 of the boss fight will protect him whenever possible but are also vulnerable to ailments
    * Spam Dormin Rush and Lullaby to prevent them from covering the boss
    * Follow up with Technical damage to quickly finish the battle

#### Pyramid Palace
* Farm Anzu spawns near the beginning for Aluminum Sheets
    * You need 20 for the Eternal Lockpick
    * Anzu is weak to Gun
* The flaming shadows only know Bless and Curse attacks, easily countered with Shiki-Ouji
* If you get Attack Mirrors or Repel Phys on all the party before the boss drops you can counter with massive damage since Phys is extra effective against her

#### Space Port Palace
* Farm Decarabia spawns near the beginning for Liquid Mercury
    * You need 10 for the Eternal Lockpick
    * Decarabia is weak to Phys
* Mothman spawns near the middle are weak to Gun
* Arahabaki and Girimehkala repel Phys and Gun
* The Will Seed mini-boss only knows Phys and Bless attacks, easily countered with Shiki-Ouji
* The boss starts with waves of 4 robo enemies each that will restart will full health if not defeated in 2 rounds
    * Need to maximize damage output to efficiently clear waves
    * Prepare a spread of single-target attack items for every element
    * Fuse a spread of personas with all-target element spells and boosts and a Concentrate buffer for Joker
    * During a wave Joker leads with Concentrate, rest of party knocks down a single robo with an element item to maximize Baton Pass chain, and Joker finishes with 2 casts of a max-buffed all-target spell exploiting current wave weakness

#### Casino Palace
* You can hold Third Eye down the entire time to see enemies in darkness
* The mini-boss rush telegraphs their attack moves so you can counter in time with the right persona resistances

#### Cruiser Palace
* The cleaner mini-boss only knows Phys and Curse attacks, easily countered with Shiki-Ouji

#### Depths of Mementos
* Your best chance to encounter Hope Diamond is to save at the first Safe Room and reload the outside encounter until Hope Diamond appears

#### Qliphoth World
* Your best chance to encounter Crystal Skull is to reload for a Mara encounters where one of the Slimes is replaced with a Crystal Skull

#### Research Lab Palace
* The flaming shadows repel Phys and Gun and have no weaknesses, meaning Technical attacks are your only way of reliably knocking them down

### Mementos
#### Requests
* Requests unlock additional mini-bosses that can be defeated in Mementos
* Most requests unlock through reading your phone messages and receiving a target name
* Your phone holds only the 50 latest messages, meaning you can be permanently locked out of a request if you fail to read it
* Some requests lack a target name and require additional steps to ID them
* Requests unlocked by confidant progress except Moon must be completed before proceeding to the next rank
* Because some targets are vulnerable to Confusion and bosses cannot run away, you can get them to throw away up to Y200,000 per turn with a 99 Lu persona
* 2 requests can only be ended through successful negotiation **(Royal)**
