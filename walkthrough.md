* Similarly you can clear palaces however you like as long as you adhere to the schedule
* When infiltrating Mementos you must finish all listed requests to proceed with confidant schedule
* Helpful suggestions are listed under Palace Tips section

#### Mementos Requests
* Requests are unlocked by ranking up confidants and reading messages from Mishima
* Your phone holds only the last 50 messages, making some permanently missable if not read
* Always read all your messages, fast-forward through them if you wish
* Some requests lack a target and must be investigated in the overworld to ID them

#### Confidant Rank Up Points
* You normally acquire enough points to unlock a confidant's next rank up event by giving positive responses to their prompts during conversations
* When you give a correct response you get 1 to 3 confidant points that are represented as blue musical notes that fly offscreen
* The sparkles that accompany the notes also show if you have enough points to rank up
    * If the sparkles remain over the confidant's head you do not have enough points
    * If the sparkles fly offscreen with the notes the next hangout will be a rank up event
* This guide notes the optimal answers along with their position, tentative translation, and expected confidant points

#### Omitted Confidant Answers
* All prompts where no response gives confidant points
* Ranks 1 and 10 which are always followed by a rank up event
* Fool, Magician, and Judgement which rank up automatically
* Moon which solely ranks up based on completing Mementos requests
* Sun which ranks up every meeting regardless of answers

#### Ranking Up Strength
* Strength which solely ranks up based on completing fusion requests
* You can complete their requests at your own pace so long you finish before the 12/24 deadline
* See the Strength Confidant section for suggested fusion pathways

#### Carrying Matching Arcana
* Carrying a persona of the same arcana while talking to a confidant gives an extra confidant point +1 for every response that normally gives confidant points
* The persona only has to be in your stock and not necessarily equipped
* This guide expects you to always carry the matching arcana for confidant events after 4/20
* Included events include all confidant rank ups as well some unique cases
    * Non-rank up hangout events
    * Relationship Fortunes by Chihaya
    * Hierophant when making coffee or cleaning Leblanc
    * Lovers when answering class questions on 4/25, 6/20, and 7/7
* You never need matching arcana for Fool, Magician, Strength, Moon, Sun, and Judgement confidants

#### Romancing a Confidant
* This guide is structured so you can choose to romance any on the 10 potential confidants upon reaching Rank 9
* Death Rank 10 is moved from daytime to evening if you romance so there are 2 spots where it can occur
* There are additional endgame benefits if you do not romance more than 1 confidant on the same save file
    * On 2/15 the remaining 9 confidants and Judgement gift you with a friendship chocolate

#### Chihaya's Fortunes
* Luck: Boosts selected stat gains for rest of day, used when Social Stat +3 will happen
* Money: Boosts Metaverse money gains for rest of day, used with infiltrating palaces
