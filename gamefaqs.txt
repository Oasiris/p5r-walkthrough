===Palace Tips===
====Efficient Leveling====
* Look for enemies weak to Gun and spam your normal gun attack for knock downs since ammo replenishes fully after every battle
* Use ailments and Phys skills with ailment effects to buy time in random encounters if they deal a lot of damage and follow up with Technicals
* Avoid challenging flaming shadows until you are close to securing the Treasure Route to ensure you have enough SP and level gains
* The 3rd Will Seed in every palace in guarded by a mini-boss with a short skill cycle you can exploit
* Specific Treasure Demons are a lot easier to find in their source palace with a Treasure Trap rather than crawling Mementos to catch them later on
* At Lv. 18 you can fuse Shiki-Ouji which nulls Phys, Gun, Bless, and Curse, which you can use to solo rush some otherwise troublesome encounters later on
* Death Rank 7 sells Invigorate 3 accessories for Y50,000 each allowing you to be much more generous with SP afterwards
* Near late game the fastest way to gain levels, money, and items is to use Chariot Rank 7 combined with Jose's Mementos changes to continuously ambush and instant kill enemies
* In late game level your Technical rank to 5 so you get guaranteed knockdowns even against the random encounters without weaknesses

====Castle Palace====
* If you want the "Expert Lockpicker" award early on you can save-reload the locked chest in front of the Safe Room
* Get the timing right on the rooftop flaming shadow patrol to avoid futile encounters
* Angel spawns near the end are weak to Gun

====Mementos Palace====
* Time your visits so you can clear a bunch of requests at once while still advancing your confidants
* Make it all the way to the next locked stairs before returning

====Museum Palace====
* If you level to 15 before the scripted Regent encounter you can fuse a persona with Frei to knock it down
* The Will Seed mini-boss follows up Flash Bomb and Brain Jack with Psi attacks aiming for Technical damage
* Exploit the obvious weaknesses during phase 2 of the boss fight to Baton Pass chain ending with Joker for maximum damage

====Bank Palace====
* The backups in phase 2 of the boss fight will protect him whenever possible but are also vulnerable to ailments
** Spam Dormin Rush and Lullaby to prevent them from covering the boss
** Follow up with Technical damage to quickly finish the battle

====Pyramid Palace====
* Farm Anzu spawns near the beginning for Aluminum Sheets
** You need 20 for the Eternal Lockpick
** Anzu is weak to Gun
* The flaming shadows only know Bless and Curse attacks, easily countered with Shiki-Ouji
* If you get Attack Mirrors or Repel Phys on all the party before the boss drops you can counter with massive damage since Phys is extra effective against her

====Space Port Palace====
* Farm Decarabia spawns near the beginning for Liquid Mercury
** You need 10 for the Eternal Lockpick
** Decarabia is weak to Phys
* Mothman spawns near the middle are weak to Gun
* Arahabaki and Girimehkala repel Phys and Gun
* The Will Seed mini-boss only knows Phys and Bless attacks, easily countered with Shiki-Ouji
* The boss starts with waves of 4 robo enemies each that will restart will full health if not defeated in 2 rounds
** Need to maximize damage output to efficiently clear waves
** Prepare a spread of single-target attack items for every element
** Fuse a spread of personas with all-target element spells and boosts and a Concentrate buffer for Joker
** During a wave Joker leads with Concentrate, rest of party knocks down a single robo with an element item to maximize Baton Pass chain, and Joker finishes with 2 casts of a max-buffed all-target spell exploiting current wave weakness

====Casino Palace====
* You can hold Third Eye down the entire time to see enemies in darkness
* The mini-boss rush telegraphs their attack moves so you can counter in time with the right persona resistances

====Cruiser Palace====
* The cleaner mini-boss only knows Phys and Curse attacks, easily countered with Shiki-Ouji

====Depths of Mementos====
* Your best chance to encounter Hope Diamond is to save at the first Safe Room and reload the outside encounter until Hope Diamond appears

====Qliphoth World====
* Your best chance to encounter Crystal Skull is to reload for a Mara encounters where one of the Slimes is replaced with a Crystal Skull

====Research Lab Palace====
* The flaming shadows repel Phys and Gun and have no weaknesses, meaning Technical attacks are your only way of reliably knocking them down

===Mementos===
====Requests====
* Requests unlock additional mini-bosses that can be defeated in Mementos
* Most requests unlock through reading your phone messages and receiving a target name
* Your phone holds only the 50 latest messages, meaning you can be permanently locked out of a request if you fail to read it
* Some requests lack a target name and require additional steps to ID them
* Requests unlocked by confidant progress except Moon must be completed before proceeding to the next rank
* Because some targets are vulnerable to Confusion and bosses cannot run away, you can get them to throw away up to Y200,000 per turn with a 99 Lu persona
* 2 requests can only be ended through successful negotiation ''(Royal)''

====Metaverse Progress====
* All palaces were cleared on Normal using the minimum number of in-game days without using SP items
* Similarly you can clear palaces however you like as long as you adhere to the schedule
* When infiltrating Mementos you must finish all listed requests to proceed with confidant schedule
* Helpful suggestions are listed under Palace Tips section

====Mementos Requests====
* Requests are unlocked by ranking up confidants and reading messages from Mishima
* Your phone holds only the last 50 messages, making some permanently missable if not read
* Always read all your messages, fast-forward through them if you wish
* Some requests lack a target and must be investigated in the overworld to ID them

====Confidant Rank Up Points====
* You normally acquire enough points to unlock a confidant's next rank up event by giving positive responses to their prompts during conversations
* When you give a correct response you get 1 to 3 confidant points that are represented as blue musical notes that fly offscreen
* The sparkles that accompany the notes also show if you have enough points to rank up
** If the sparkles remain over the confidant's head you do not have enough points
** If the sparkles fly offscreen with the notes the next hangout will be a rank up event

* Included events include all confidant rank ups as well some unique cases
** Non-rank up hangout events

* You never need matching arcana for Fool, Magician, Strength, Moon, Sun, and Judgement confidants

====Romancing a Confidant====
* This guide is structured so you can choose to romance any on the 10 potential confidants upon reaching Rank 9
* Death Rank 10 is moved from daytime to evening if you romance so there are 2 spots where it can occur
* There are additional endgame benefits if you do not romance more than 1 confidant on the same save file
